# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
PyBer, a ridesharing company, has assigned us with conducting an analysis of the relationships between the type of city, and the number of drivers, rides and average fares. To best illustrate these relationships, we have provided visualizations in order for PyBer to better understand and utilize this data to improve the access to their services in underserved communities. 

Resources
- Data Sources: city_data.csv and ride_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Jupyter Notebook
- Dependencies: pandas and matplotlib

## Results
In the dataframe below, we organized the city and ride data by the three city types, rural, suburban, urban.

As expected, urban cities yielded the most total rides, total drivers, and total fares.
The average fare per ride was the highest in rural areas at $34.62, $4 more than suburban areas and $10 more than urban areas.
The average fare per driver was the highest in rural areas at $55.49, $16 higher than suburban cities and $39 higher than urban cities. 

Based on the total fares per city type, we then created a graph with the three types from January 1st 2019 to April 29th 2019 charted for each week.

Urban cities consistently produced highest total fares per week followed by suburban areas, and rural areas producing the lowest.
